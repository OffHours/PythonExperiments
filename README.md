# PythonExperiments
A collection of all the files and projects I'm accumulating on my quest to learn python. 
Some might be useful to others and some are just test benches for random stuff.

Generally I work in industrial automation but I have for a long time been interested the power and potential of adding traditional software engineering to my repertoire. 
Especially since the lines between automation engineering and software engineering are getting more blurry by the minute. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them an if I can hwlp you with anything send me a message.
