"""
A simple todo app with a graphical user interface built using the framwork PySimpleGui.
It has all the functions of the CLI interface except for the help command. 
It is pretty self explanatory so I didn't find it necessary to include any help texts.

To run the app you need to have a local install of PySimpleGui.
The easiest way to install it is using pip.
Run the command: "pip install PySimpleGui"
You can also have it installed in a virtual evironment but that is beyond this readme.

You also need to have a .txt file named "todo.txt" in the same folder as the functions.py and gui.py files.
